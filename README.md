# face_recognition_attendance_system_djangoML

A face recognition attendance system using Django and machine learning involves using the Django web framework to build a web-based application for recording and managing employee/student attendance, and using machine learning algorithms to implement the face recognition functionality. This system would likely involve capturing images or video of employees'/students faces as they clock in and out, and then using a trained machine learning model to compare those images to a database of known employees/students to verify their identities. The system would also likely include features for tracking attendance data, generating reports, and even sending emails timely to respective faculty or head.
